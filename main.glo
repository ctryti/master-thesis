name={NDRange}, description={The kernels are executed in parallel over a specified number of work items, an NDRange, or N-dimensional range, that can be 1, 2 or 3 dimensions. As an example, if we have a kernel that is supposed to do something to every pixel in an image of size 256x256, we can launch a 2-dimensional range with width and height of the image. We then have one work item for each pixel, addressable by its x and y coordinates in the image.}
