\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:concl}

Block matching is currently one of the fastest dense depth map
algorithms [TODO: source?]. Though the quality is far from the best,
it is probably usable in some applications. With GPUs and CPUs getting
better and cheaper, the OpenCL and CUDA frameworks maturing, a regular
home computer has the computing power of a small super-computer, depth
estimation

\section{Future work}

Paired with a silhouette extractor, the speed and quality can be
further improved. Silhouettes can be used to identify object borders
and depth discontinuities so they can be treated differently, with a
smaller aggregation window for example, or a different cost matching
method, and also mask out a region of interest, allowing the depth
estimator to ignore background, if it is of no interest.

A better understanding of signal processing and image sampling is
needed to improve on the Pyramid algorithm and Compute mask steps.
